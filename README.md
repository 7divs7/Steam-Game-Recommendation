# Steam Game Recommendation

This project aims to provide personalized game recommendations on Steam using two different approaches:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizing TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend games based on their content features.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Implementing Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) with TensorFlow to offer recommendations based on implicit user interactions and preferences.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam) which contains detailed information about Steam games, user reviews, and game metadata.
